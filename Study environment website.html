<h1>Study environments</h1>
<p>This website is about the research of different effects of study environments, aiming to show what study environments are most effective</p>

 <h2>Breif explanation</h2>
   <p2> I am going to evidence my aim through showing the frequency of how individuals perefence of how they study through a set of multiple choice question as a primary source of data. And then also present a piece of data from online as a secondary data. I chose to do this topic because I became very interested towards how people study and what are the best ways to improve my study habits as it will be very important to me and anyone who is currently studying VCE and people who are about to study VCE.</p2>

  <h2>Primary data</h2>

  <p>This data presented some of the data obtained when I was doing my survey. A breif description of the data presented shows that students found that using a device to listen to music while studying compared to them studying quietly, another piece of data presented, shows that many of the students would much more prefer using online sources to get their data rather than using the libary or text books as they found that they were able to find information faster and at the same time able to better understand the topic in research as they find that they are able to find broader information on the topic</p>

  <p>The folowing data presented was a research project done in the Univeristy of Damman. In this research topic they recorded 219 students use of devices when studying, in which research shows that they all rely on different types devices when studying. At then end of this research the results showed that through the usage of technology there has been a significant increase in academic achievement compared to tech free studying.

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>From the results I obtained, I found that commonly people study better while using technology, that is not just limited by phone or laptop, as people that I have surveyed revealed that whent they study they only carry around their mp3 player and leave their phones a good distance away as they find that when studying seeing a phone can very much distract them from doing study as they just want to pick and play on their phone, and due to this there is also a small portion of individuals that prefer when studying not using technology of any sorts, instead they prefer using pen and paper as to some people they find it is more effective way of remembering things. Students also found that searching for information through the use of electronical devices was much more easier than spending a abundance of time reading through the text book to find one bit of information and also through going onto the web there are also a wider range of defining the topic shown in different ways. </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In conclusion from the research I have done on this topic, I found that while studying without technology is a effective way of remembering the content, but when trying to find information it becomes a more of a complicated job wasting a lot of time. However, using technology seems to also has it's benefits as you are able to find information faster, and are able to record information faster, also through listening to music, an individual is able to follow the beat in which they were able to calm themselves and focus on the work. But using technology also has it's disadvantages as people I have surveyed they found using technology while studying they become distracted really easily. In which this concludes that both using technology or using pen and paper when studying has its benefits and limits, and is dependent on how well and individual concentrates.</p>
